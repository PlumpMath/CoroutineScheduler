# Coroutine scheduler

A fast, low-allocation coroutine system with a focus on, but not limited to, games.

The implementation re-uses objects as much a possible using object pooling. The only garbage is generated by creating the IEnumerator when starting the co-routine.

## Features

- Fast, single-threaded co-routine scheduler.
- Easy to use and very similar to Unity3D co-routines.
- Co-routines are composable.

## Example

    IEnumerator Routine1() {
    	yield return WaitCommand.WaitSeconds(1f);
    	// Do something
        yield return WaitCommand.WaitFrames(5);
		// Do something else
		// Wait for another co-routine to finish
		yield return WaitCommand.WaitRoutine(OtherRoutine());
        yield return WaitCommand.WaitForNextFrame;
		// Finalize
    }

    // Create a scheduler and start the co-routine
    var s = new CoroutineScheduler();
    s.Start(Routine1());

    void Update() {
        // You control the update-rate of the scheduler
        scheduler.Update(Time.FrameCount, Time.CurrentTime);
    }
